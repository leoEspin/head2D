# Parallel C++ solver for the 2D heat equation
Execute **heat_demo.sh** to run a complete simulation of the 2D heat equation on a rectangle which is heated on two sides. 

The script will ask you to generate an input file (click ok for the defaults) and then it will compile and run the main code. The results will be plotted and stored in *Heated tile.pdf*.

Execute **parallel_heat.sh** to test execution speed ups with multithreading.
